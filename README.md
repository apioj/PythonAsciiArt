Hello! Welcome to my Python Ascii Art Generator.

The code requires too simple user inputs before producing the art.
The two inputs being the absolute file path in line 12.

" image = iio.imread('enter your file path here') "

Please use forward slashes, in the file path name if you are on a windows machine.

Then the second input before running the code is in line 66:

 " with open('name_of_text_file_here.txt' , w)"

 the code needs to have a filename for the file that it will create.

 It will then create the file in the same project folder as the main.py file.

The code uses the image library imageio.v3 to analyse the pixel brightness.
